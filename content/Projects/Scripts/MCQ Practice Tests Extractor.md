TODO:
- [ ] Get the questions and answers. Extract the from books
- [x] Combine them and format then into an obsidian.md compatible form

I've created a script that combines the questions and the answers on separate files into one nicely formatted file that can be imported into obsidian. You can find it [here](https://github.com/Arthur-K-99/obsidian-mcq-formatter)

This is most likely going to be used for studying for basic certifications.

I still need to efficiently create a script that extract the text nicely from the pdfs.
