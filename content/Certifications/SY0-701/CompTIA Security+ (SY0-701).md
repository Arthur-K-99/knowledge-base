# Objectives
- 1.0 General Security Concepts
	-  1.1 Compare and contrast various types of security controls
		- Categories (Technical, Managerial, Operational, Physical)
		- Control types (Preventive, Deterrent, Detective, Corrective, Compensating, Directive)
	- 1.2 Summarize fundamental security concepts
		- Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA)
		- Non-­ repudiation
		- Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) (Authenticating people, authenticating systems, authorization models)
		- Gap analysis
		- Zero trust (control plane, data plane)
		- Physical security (bollards, access control vestibule, fencing, video surveillance, security guard, access badge, lighting, sensors)
		- Deception and disruption technology (honeypot, honeynet, honeyfile, honeytoken)
	- 1.3 Explain the importance of change management processes and the impact to security
		- Business processes impacting security operations (approval process, ownership, stakeholders, impact analysis, test results, backout plan, maintenance window, standard operating procedure)
		- Technical implications (allow lists/deny lists, restricted activities, downtime, service restart, application restart, legacy applications, dependencies)
		- Documentation (updating diagrams, updating policies/procedures)
		- Version control
	- 1.4 Explain the importance of using appropriate cryptographic solutions
		- Public key infrastructure (PKI) (Public key, private, key, key escrow)
		- Encryption (Level, transport/communication, asymmetric, symmetric, key exchange, algorithms, key length)
		- Tools (Trusted Platform Module \[TPM], Hardware security module \[HSM], key management systems, secure enclave)
		- Obfuscation (Steganography, tokenization, data masking)
		- Hashing
		- Salting
		- Digital Signatures
		- Key stretching
		- Blockchain
		- Open public ledger
		- Certificates (certificate authorities, certificate revocation lists \[CRLs], Online Certificate Status Protocol \[OCSP], self-­signed, third-­party, root of trust, certificate signing request \[CSR] generation, wildcard)
- 2.0 Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations
